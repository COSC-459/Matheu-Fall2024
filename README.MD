# Overview

My project aims to develop a Universal Clipboard Application that allows users to seamlessly share and sync clipboard data across multiple devices in real time. The app will be built using React and Tailwind CSS for the front end, Node.js for the server-side logic, Supabase as the backend for real-time database and authentication, and Tauri for creating a cross-platform desktop application. (Running this on your local machine won't work since I removed my Supabase keys)

# Key Features

The main goal is to build a functional, reliable, and secure universal clipboard that allows users to copy data on one device and paste it onto another, whether they are using macOS and Windows.

1. **Cross-device Syncing**: Enable real-time clipboard synchronization between multiple devices.
2. **Cross-platform Support**: Build a cross-platform app using Electron, ensuring compatibility with macOS and Windows.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabaseâ€™s real-time capabilities to keep clipboard data synchronized without delays.
4. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication using Supabase for secure and private clipboard data syncing.
5. **UI/UX Design**: Design a simple, intuitive, and responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS and React.
6. **Security**: Implement encryption for clipboard data during transmission and storage to ensure user privacy and security.
